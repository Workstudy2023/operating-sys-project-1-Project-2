Operating Systems Project: Simulated System Clock and Worker Processes
Overview

This project is an extension of a previously created utility that launched user processes with specific limits. In this iteration, we have introduced a simulated system clock in shared memory, and a Process Control Block (PCB) structure to maintain process details. There are two main executables: oss and worker.

The oss executable launches worker processes and maintains a simulated system clock, while worker processes examine this clock and decide when to terminate based on provided durations.

Accessing the Development Environment
Prerequisites:

It runs on any Linux machine

Setup and Execution

Prerequisites:
 Clone the project git@github.com:Workstudy2023/operating-sys-project-1-Project-2.git
•	Access to the development environment (as described above).
•	Ensure the oss and worker executables are compiled and ready.

Execution:

1.	To run the main executable oss: oss [-h] [-n proc] [-s simul] [-t timelimit]


Project Structure
Simulated System Clock
The clock consists of two integers, one storing second and the other storing nanoseconds. Both values are initialized to zero and are present in shared memory.

Process Control Block (PCB)

Each PCB structure contains:

•	occupied: Indicates if the PCB is in use.
•	pid: The process ID of the child process.
•	startSeconds: The time (seconds) when the child was forked.
•	startNano: The time (nanoseconds) when the child was forked.

Worker Process Behavior

Each worker process checks the simulated system clock in shared memory and computes its termination time. It then repeatedly checks the clock until it's time for it to terminate.

Additional Notes

The project is designed to simulate an OS's system clock functionality and manage processes through a simulated environment by using a shared memory mechanism. Care has been taken to ensure synchronization, proper memory access, and cleanup.

 Test
I tested this project by executing the following three test with the respective parameters. I attached the results file for each test. The results for this test are included in the folder.

First test 
 ./oss -n 2  -s 2  -t 2
results-n2-s2-t2.txt

Second test
./oss -n 10  -s 2  -t 5
results-n10-s2-t5.txt

Last test
./oss -n 20 -s 2  -t 2
results-n20-s2-t2.txt
